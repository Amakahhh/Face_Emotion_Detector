# ✅ Ready to Run Checklist (With Trained Model)

## Current Status

### ✅ What You HAVE:
- ✅ **Trained model** (face_emotionModel.h5) from friend ✓
- ✅ **All code files ready** ✓
- ✅ **Python installed** (3.13.1) ✓

### ❌ What You STILL NEED:

**1. Install Dependencies (REQUIRED)**
- Flask, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Pandas, NumPy, Pillow
- **Status:** Not installed yet
- **Time:** 5-10 minutes
- **Cannot skip:** App won't run without these

**2. Verify Model File Location**
- Model should be in project root: `Ejike_22CG031853\face_emotionModel.h5`
- **Status:** Need to verify/move to correct location

**3. That's it!**
- ✅ You DON'T need dataset (you have trained model)
- ✅ You DON'T need to train model (you have it from friend)
- ✅ You just need dependencies installed!

## 🎯 Quick Steps to Run:

### Step 1: Verify Model File Location
**Make sure `face_emotionModel.h5` is here:**
```
C:\Users\DELL 7300\pace website\Ejike_22CG031853\face_emotionModel.h5
```
(Same folder as app.py)

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (5-10 min)
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the App!
```bash
python app.py
```

Then open: **http://127.0.0.1:5000**

## ✅ Summary:

**You need ONLY:**
1. ✅ Trained model (you have it!)
2. ✅ Code files (you have them!)
3. ❌ Dependencies installed (5-10 min wait)

**You DON'T need:**
- ❌ Dataset download (only needed for training)
- ❌ Model training (you have trained model from friend)

## 🚀 Almost There!

Just install dependencies and you're ready to run!
