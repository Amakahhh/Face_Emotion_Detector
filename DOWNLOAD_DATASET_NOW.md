## 📝 Note About Dependencies

**Important:** You CAN download the dataset without dependencies, BUT you'll need them for:
- ✅ Training the model (`model_training.py` needs TensorFlow, pandas, numpy)
- ✅ Running the web app (`app.py` needs Flask, TensorFlow, OpenCV)

So download the dataset now (no dependencies needed), but you'll need to install dependencies before training/running.
